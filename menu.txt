The rules of blackjack are simple.
In this game, you will be playing against one opponent, the dealer.
Both you and the dealer will be dealt 2 cards.
Both of your cards will be face up, while the dealer will only have one card face up.
The goal of this game is to have the total value of your cards to be higher 
than the dealer's cards while keeping it under 21.
If you go over 21, then you "bust" and lose your bet.
If the total value of the dealer's cards are higher than yours, then you also lose your bet.
If the value of both your cards and the dealer's is equal, then it is a tie and your bet will be returned.
The face value of the card is also the card's value. (E.g. 6 is 6, 2 is 2, 10 is 10 etc.)
However, Jack/Queen/King are royalty and they have the value of 10.
Aces can take on the value of either 1 or 11.
Aces will be 11 as long as your total value isn't over 21. If above 21, the Ace will change its value to 1.
If you achieve blackjack, 21 pts, with any combination, you will be paid 2.5 times your bet.
If you win normally (have a higher value [under 21] than the dealer) then you will be paid 2 times your bet.
If you are not satisfied with your original hand's total value (the 2 cards you had in the beginning), 
then you can take an extra card by selecting "hit".
You get one extra card each time you hit. 
However, repetitively hitting has the risk of your hand's value going over 21 and busting.
The dealer's rules for hitting is that if his hand is less than or equal to 16 or he has a "soft 17" (an ace and a 6), 
then he must take a hit.
If the dealer's hand is 17 or higher without an ace, then the dealer must stand.
Lastly, if you are satisfied with your hand's value, then you can stand and end your turn.
Good Luck in your gambling.
